    <p>Well, Odin Recipes is an assignment given to the students of <a href="https://theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> learning HTML, and this is my version of the site. There are many other versions of this site, some more polished than the others. I tried to spice it up a little bit on my very poor CSS skills (for now!). Excuse the poor roleplay into being an Asgardian :) Also, I am aware nothing is properly centered, and I am open to suggestions as to how to fix those. You can find me on Discord at Lxran#2292 or GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Lxran/">Lxran</a>.</p>
